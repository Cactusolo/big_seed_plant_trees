# big_seed_plant_trees

Here we provide trees that were constructed with GenBank and the Open Tree of Life synthesis and taxonomy. These trees were constructed with methods described in Smith and Brown (in review). We construct these trees by conducting targeted analyses on individual clades. The data for those clades (alignments and trees) can be found [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eebsmith/big_seed_plant_datasets/). 

The trees themselves can be downloaded in the [release section](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/big_seed_plant_trees/releases). 

### updates
We will continue to update these trees and will post updates to the release section. The individual alignments and trees available [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eebsmith/big_seed_plant_datasets/index.html) will always point to the most recent versions. 

### errors
These trees are large and likely to include some errors the sources of which could be from any of the source data (GenBank, Open Tree) or from analyses. Please note these in the [issues](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/big_seed_plant_trees/issues) section here on github. We would like to correct these so other users don't have the same problems.
